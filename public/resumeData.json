        "description":"U of A's 3 month intensive full stack bootcamp will forever be a memorable experience. The BootCamp equipped me with the latest and greatest trending techlogies to date. From the start, it was fast pace into HTML/JS/CSS then we dove even deeper into ExpressJS for our servers, NodeJS, MongoDb for our databases, and ReactJS. The best part about this was the indepence & group projects. Seeing others struggle with me took some weight off me and taught me that it's normal and part of the process. I can look back now and see that as fast as it was, and I know I have a lot more to learn, but I left knowing more then I started with. I feel more confident & competent in my skills."
